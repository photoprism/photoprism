    # property in devcontainer.json to cause VS Code its sub-processes (terminals, tasks, 
    # debugging) to execute as the user. Uncomment the next line if you want the entire 
    # container to run as this user instead. Note that, on Linux, you may need to

    # folder. Note that the path of the Dockerfile and context is relative to the *primary* 
    # docker-compose.yml file (the first in the devcontainer.json "dockerComposeFile"
