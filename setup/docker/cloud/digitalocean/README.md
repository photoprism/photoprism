GETTING STARTED
---------------------------------------

It may take a few minutes until your Droplet is provisioned, and all services have been initialized.

The initial admin password is stored on your Droplet, you'll see it when running these commands:

```
ssh root@YOUR-SERVER-IP
cat /root/.initial-password.txt
```

You can then access your instance by opening the following URL in a Web browser (see "Using Let's Encrypt HTTPS" for how to get a valid certificate):

```
https://YOUR-SERVER-IP/
```

All files related to PhotoPrism can be found in `/opt/photoprism`. It is running as "photoprism" (UID 1000) by default.

To edit the main config file containing services, storage paths, and basic settings (save changes by pressing *Ctrl+O*, then *Ctrl+X* to exit):

```
cd /opt/photoprism
nano compose.yaml
```

Remember to restart services for changes to take effect:

```
docker compose stop
docker compose up -d
```

## Using Let's Encrypt HTTPS ##

By default, a self-signed certificate will be used for HTTPS connections. Browsers are going to show a security warning because of that. Depending on your settings, they may also refuse connecting at all.

To get an official, free HTTPS certificate from Let's Encrypt, your server needs a fully qualified public domain name, e.g. "photos.yourdomain.com".

You may add a static DNS entry (on DigitalOcean go to Networking > Domains) for this, or use a Dynamic DNS service of your choice.

Once your server has a public domain name, please disable the self-signed certificate and enable domain based routing in compose.yaml and traefik.yaml (see inline instructions in !! UPPERCASE !!):

```
ssh root@YOUR-SERVER-IP
cd /opt/photoprism
nano compose.yaml
nano traefik.yaml
```

Then restart services for the changes to take effect:

```
docker compose stop
docker compose up -d
```

You should now be able to access your instance without security warnings:

```
https://photos.yourdomain.com/
```

Note the first request may still fail while Traefik gets and installs the new certificate. Try again after 30 seconds.

## System Requirements ##

We recommend hosting PhotoPrism on a server with at least 2 cores and 4 GB of memory. Indexing and searching may be slow on smaller Droplets, depending on how many and what types of files you upload.
