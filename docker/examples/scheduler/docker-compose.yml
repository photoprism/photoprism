# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Linux / AMD64)
# Includes Ophelia, a docker job scheduler: https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia
#
# Note:
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), especially when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:
#   https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/proxies/traefik/

    ## Don't enable automatic restarts until PhotoPrism has been properly configured and tested!
    ## If the service gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory, filesystem, network, or database issue:

      - "~/Pictures:/photoprism/originals"               # original media files (photos and videos)
      # - "/example/family:/photoprism/originals/family" # *additional* media folders can be mounted like this
      # - "~/Import:/photoprism/import"                  # *optional* base folder from which files can be imported to originals
      - "./storage:/photoprism/storage"                  # *writable* storage folder for cache, database, and sidecar files (never remove)

  ## Database Server (recommended)
  ## see https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#should-i-use-sqlite-mariadb-or-mysql
  mariadb:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: mariadb:10.6
    container_name: mariadb
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
      - apparmor:unconfined

    ## Never store database files on an unreliable device such as a USB flash drive, an SD card, or a shared network folder:
    volumes:
      - "./database:/var/lib/mysql" # Important, don't remove
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: insecure
      MYSQL_DATABASE: photoprism
