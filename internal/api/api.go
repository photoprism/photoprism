//	@title						PhotoPrism API
//	@description				API request bodies and responses are usually JSON-encoded, except for binary data and some of the OAuth2 endpoints. Note that the `Content-Type` header must be set to `application/json` for this, as the request may otherwise fail with error 400.
//	@description				When clients have a valid access token, e.g. obtained through the `POST /api/v1/session` or `POST /api/v1/oauth/token` endpoint, they can use a standard Bearer Authorization header to authenticate their requests. Submitting the access token with a custom `X-Auth-Token` header is supported as well.
