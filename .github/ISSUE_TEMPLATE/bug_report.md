**What does not work as expected?**

Our troubleshooting checklists help you quickly find and fix common problems:
https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/

**How can we reproduce it?**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

If reporting an Import, Indexing, or Performance issue, please include the number and type of pictures in your library,
as well as any configuration options you have changed e.g. for thumbnail quality.

**What behavior do you expect?**

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**What could be the cause of your problem?**

Before reporting a bug, try to determine the cause of your problem:
https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/

**Can you provide us with example files for testing, error logs, or screenshots?**

Please add example files or screenshots that help to reproduce your problem.
You may also send files via email or share a download link:

Learn how to diagnose frontend issues:
https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/

IMPORTANT: Always provide a sample file and logs if it is an Import, Indexing, or Metadata issue, otherwise we will not be able to process your report.

**Which software versions do you use?**

- PhotoPrism Architecture & Build Number (AMD64, ARM64, ARMv7,...)
- Database Type & Version (MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite,...)
- Operating System Types & Versions (Linux, Windows, Android,...)
- Browser Types & Versions (Firefox, Chrome, Safari on iPhone,...)
- Browser Plugins & Ad Blockers (if any)

NOTE: The app version / build number can be found in *Settings* when you scroll to the bottom. MySQL 8 is not officially supported anymore, see FAQs and Release Notes.

IMPORTANT:
1. Always provide database and operating system details if it is a Backend, Import, or Indexing issue.
2. Always provide web browser and operating system details if it is a Frontend issue.
3. If it is a Performance problem, you must provide ALL information.

**On what kind of device is PhotoPrism installed?**

This is especially important if you are reporting a Performance, Import, or Indexing problem. You can skip this if you are reporting a problem found on our public demo, or if it is a completely unrelated issue, such as a broken page layout.

- Device / Processor Type (Raspberry Pi 4, Intel Core i7-3770, AMD Ryzen 7 3800X,...)
- Physical Memory & Swap Space (in GB)
- Storage Type (HDD, SSD, RAID, USB, Network Storage,...) 
- anything else that might be helpful

IMPORTANT: Always provide device, memory, and storage details when you have a Backend, Performance, Import, or Indexing issue.

**Do you use a Reverse Proxy, Firewall, VPN, or CDN?**

If yes, please specify type and version. You can skip this if you are reporting a completely unrelated issue.

IMPORTANT:
1. Always provide this information when you have a Reliability, Performance, or Frontend problem, such as failed uploads, connection errors, broken thumbnails, or video playback issues.
2. If you are using NGINX, add its configuration and consider asking the NGINX community for advice as we do not specialize in supporting their product (which is known to be difficult to configure properly). We recommend using Traefik as reverse proxy instead.
