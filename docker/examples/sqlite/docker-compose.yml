# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Linux / AMD64)
#
# Note:
# - Use SQLite only for small libraries and testing. SQLite locks the index on updates, so other operations have to
#   wait. In the worst case, this can lead to timeout errors. MariaDB is optimized for high concurrency.
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), for example, when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:

    ## Use photoprism/photoprism:preview for testing preview builds:
    image: photoprism/photoprism:latest
    ## Don't enable automatic restarts until PhotoPrism has been properly configured and tested!
    ## If the service gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory, filesystem, network, or database issue:

      ### Add/update packages (service must be started as root; options: update, gpu, tensorflow, davfs, clean):
      # PHOTOPRISM_INIT: "update gpu tensorflow clean"
      ## Run as a specific user, group, or with a custom umask (does not work together with "user:")

      # PHOTOPRISM_GID: 1000
      # PHOTOPRISM_UMASK: 0000

    ## Storage Folders: "~" is a shortcut for your home directory, "." for the current directory
    volumes:

      - "~/Pictures:/photoprism/originals"               # original media files (photos and videos)
      # - "/example/family:/photoprism/originals/family" # *additional* media folders can be mounted like this
      # - "~/Import:/photoprism/import"                  # *optional* base folder from which files can be imported to originals
      - "./storage:/photoprism/storage"                  # *writable* storage folder for cache, database, and sidecar files (never remove)
