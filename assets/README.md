the terms of the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License](https://docs.photoprism.app/license/docs/).
Other terms may apply to Digital Assets — in particular illustrations,
graphics, and videos — embedded in the documentation if they are licensed
solely for direct distribution to us. When in doubt, please ask before
distributing or using them for other works.

## Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability ##

  OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND DIGITAL ASSETS ARE PROVIDED
“AS-IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOFTWARE AND

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of
all civil liability in connection with our software and services, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability was provided in return for a fee.
