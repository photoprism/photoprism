Let's join forces
=================

PhotoPrism is a non-profit project run entirely by volunteers. We need your funds to pay for 
[organizing meetups](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Meetups),
[running our servers](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/wiki/Infrastructure),
visiting conferences, buying test devices, offering rewards for contributions, and covering our cost of living.

You're most welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero). They will match every donation in the first year.

You can also [become a sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism), [fund issues](https://issuehunt.io/repos/119160553), [donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/photoprism) or [get in touch with us](mailto:hello@photoprism.org) to discuss further details.
