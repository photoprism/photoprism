    To [recognize faces](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/organize/people/), PhotoPrism first extracts crops from your images using a [library](https://github.com/esimov/pigo) based on [pixel intensity comparisons](https://dl.photoprism.app/pdf/publications/20140820-Pixel_Intensity_Comparisons.pdf). These are then fed into TensorFlow to compute [512-dimensional vectors](https://dl.photoprism.app/pdf/publications/20150101-FaceNet.pdf) for characterization. In the final step, the [DBSCAN algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) attempts to cluster these so-called face embeddings, so they can be matched to persons with just a few clicks. A reasonable range for the similarity distance between face embeddings is between 0.60 and 0.70, with a higher value being more aggressive and leading to larger clusters with more false positives. To cluster a smaller number of faces, you can reduce the core to 3 or 2 similar faces.

We recommend that only advanced users change these parameters:`
