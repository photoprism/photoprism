TERMS OF USE

(a) Our public Documentation is available under the terms of the CC BY-NC-SA
4.0 License. Other terms may apply to Digital Assets — in particular
illustrations, graphics, and videos — embedded in the documentation if they
are licensed to us solely for direct distribution. When in doubt, please ask
before distributing or using them for other works.

(b) We hereby grant you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide,
non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the Digital Assets in
combination with the Software and Services, unless otherwise noted.

(c) Because some Digital Assets are licensed to us solely for direct
distribution, we cannot redistribute them under a more permissive license for
other purposes. If the author or copyright holder has not released them under a
permissive license, you must obtain a license before using them in your own
work, whether commercial or non-commercial in nature.

(d) All rights not expressly licensed by PhotoPrism under a License Agreement or
provided under a Public License are reserved. For the avoidance of doubt, this
also applies to promotional materials, legal documents, and any other
Intellectual Property Rights. The use, reproduction, and distribution of Open
Source Software is subject to the terms of the applicable Public License.
