# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Linux / AMD64)
#
# Note:
# - Hardware transcoding is only available for sponsors due to the high maintenance and support effort.
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), for example, when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:
#   https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/proxies/traefik/

# CLI Commands:
# - https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/#command-line-interface
#
# All commands may have to be prefixed with "sudo" when not running as root.
# This will point the home directory shortcut ~ to /root in volume mounts.

    ## If the service gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory, filesystem, network, or database issue:
