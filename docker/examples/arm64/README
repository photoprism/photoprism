PhotoPrism for the Raspberry Pi and other ARM-based devices
===========================================================

Our latest release comes as a single multi-arch image for AMD64, ARM64, and ARMv7.
If your device meets the system requirements, the same installation instructions
as for regular Linux servers apply.

To get started, simply download our example config

  https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/arm64/docker-compose.yml

to a folder of your choice, change it as needed, and run "docker-compose up":

  wget https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/arm64/docker-compose.yml
  sudo docker-compose up -d

Always change PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD so that the app starts with a secure initial password.
Never use easy-to-guess passwords or default values like insecure on publicly accessible servers.
There is no default in case no password was provided. A minimum length of 4 characters is required.

For more details, see:
  - https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/docker-compose/
  - https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/config-options/

All commands may have to be prefixed with "sudo" when not running as root.
Note that this will change the home directory "~" to "/root" in your configuration.

## Docker Compose Command Reference ##

The help command shows a complete list of commands and config options.
Use the --help flag to see a detailed command info like
"docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism backup --help".

| Action   | Command
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------
| Start    | docker-compose up -d
| Stop     | docker-compose stop
| Update   | docker-compose pull
| Logs     | docker-compose logs --tail=25 -f
| Terminal | docker-compose exec photoprism bash
| Help     | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism help
| Config   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism config
| Reset    | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism reset
| Backup   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism backup -a -i
| Restore  | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism restore -a -i
| Index    | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism index
| Re-index | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism index -f
| Import   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism import

For more examples, see https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/docker-compose/#command-line-interface

NOTE: "photoprism index -f" will re-index all originals, including already indexed and unchanged files.
      This may be necessary after upgrading, especially to new major versions.

## System Requirements ##

It's important that you boot your Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 with the parameter "arm_64bit=1"
in config.txt to use our ARM64 image.

Alternatively, you may run it on UbuntuDockerPi (https://github.com/guysoft/UbuntuDockerPi).
It's a 64bit Ubuntu Server with Docker pre-installed.

Your device should have at least 4 GB of memory. Also make sure it has at least 4 GB of swap
configured, so that indexing doesn't cause restarts when there are memory usage spikes.
Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM should match the number of cores.

Indexing large photo and video collections significantly benefits from fast, local SSD storage,
and lots of memory for caching. Especially the conversion of RAW images and the transcoding of
videos are very demanding.

## Reducing Server Load ##

If you're running out of memory - or other system resources - while indexing, please limit the
number of workers by setting PHOTOPRISM_WORKERS to a value less than the number of logical CPU cores
in docker-compose.yml.

As a measure of last resort, you may disable using TensorFlow for image classification and facial recognition.

To avoid permission issues, docker-compose.yml should include the following security options:

  photoprism:
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
      - apparmor:unconfined
