#  PhotoPrism for Cloud Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)
#  ===================================================================
#
#  Run this script as root to install PhotoPrism on a cloud server e.g. at DigitalOcean:
#
#    bash <(curl -s https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/cloud/setup.sh)
#
#  This may take a while to complete, depending on the performance of your
#  server and its internet connection.
#
#  When done - and you see no errors - please open
#
#    https://<YOUR SERVER IP>/
#
#  in a Web browser and log in using the initial admin password shown
#  by the script. You may also see the initial password by running
#
#    cat /root/.initial-password.txt
#
#  as root on your server. To open a terminal:
#
#    ssh root@<YOUR SERVER IP>
#
#  Data and all config files related to PhotoPrism can be found in
#
#    /opt/photoprism
#
#  The main docker-compose config file for changing config options is
#
#    /opt/photoprism/docker-compose.yml
#
#  The server is running as "photoprism" (UID 1000) by default. There's no need
#  to change defaults unless you experience conflicts with other services running
#  on the same server. For example, you may need to disable the Traefik reverse
#  proxy as the ports 80 and 443 can only be used by a single web server / proxy.
#
#  Configuring multiple apps on the same server is beyond the scope of this base
#  config and for advanced users only.
#
#  This config includes Ophelia, a docker job scheduler:
#
#    https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia
#
#  See jobs.ini for details.
#
#  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
#  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  We recommend hosting PhotoPrism on a server with at least 2 cores and
#  4 GB of memory. Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM
#  should match the number of cores. Indexing large photo and video
#  collections significantly benefits from fast, local SSD storage.
#
#  RAW file conversion and automatic image classification using TensorFlow
#  will be disabled on servers with less than 2 GB of physical memory.
#
#  DOCKER COMPOSE COMMAND REFERENCE
#  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Start    | docker-compose up -d
#  Stop     | docker-compose stop
#  Update   | docker-compose pull
#  Logs     | docker-compose logs --tail=25 -f
#  Terminal | docker-compose exec photoprism bash
#  Help     | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism help
#  Config   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism config
#  Reset    | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism reset
#  Backup   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism backup -a -i
#  Restore  | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism restore -a -i
#  Index    | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism index
#  Reindex  | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism index -f
#  Import   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism import
#
#  To search originals for faces without a complete rescan:
#  docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism faces index
#
#  More examples: https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/#command-line-interface
#
#  USING LET'S ENCRYPT HTTPS
#  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  If your server has a public domain name, please disable the self-signed
#  certificate and enable domain based routing in docker-compose.yml and
#  traefik.yaml (see inline instructions in !! UPPERCASE !!)
#
#    ssh root@<YOUR SERVER IP>
#    cd /opt/photoprism
#    nano docker-compose.yml
#    nano traefik.yaml
#    docker-compose stop
#    docker-compose up -d
#
#  You should now be able to access your instance without security warnings.
