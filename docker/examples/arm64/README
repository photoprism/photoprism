PhotoPrism for Raspberry Pi (64bit)
===================================

To get started, simply download our example config

  https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/arm64/docker-compose.yml

to a folder of your choice, change it as needed, and run "docker-compose up":

  wget https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/arm64/docker-compose.yml
  sudo docker-compose up -d

Please always change PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD so that PhotoPrism starts with a secure initial password.
Never use "photoprism", or other easy-to-guess passwords, on a public server.
A minimum length of 4 characters is required.

For more details, see:
  - https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/docker-compose/
  - https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/config-options/

All commands may have to be prefixed with "sudo" when not running as root.
Note that this will change the home directory "~" to "/root" in your configuration.

## Docker Compose Command Reference ##

The help command shows a complete list of commands and config options.
Use the --help flag to see a detailed command info like
"docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism backup --help".

| Action   | Command
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------
| Start    | docker-compose up -d
| Stop     | docker-compose stop
| Update   | docker-compose pull
| Logs     | docker-compose logs --tail=25 -f
| Terminal | docker-compose exec photoprism bash
| Help     | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism help
| Config   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism config
| Reset    | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism reset
| Backup   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism backup -a -i
| Restore  | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism restore -a -i
| Index    | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism index
| Re-index | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism index -f
| Import   | docker-compose exec photoprism photoprism import
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------

Note: "photoprism index -f" will re-index all originals, including already indexed and unchanged files.
This may be necessary after upgrading, especially to new major versions.

## System Requirements ##

You need to boot your Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 with the parameter "arm_64bit=1" in config.txt in order to use this image.
Alternatively, you may run the image on UbuntuDockerPi (https://github.com/guysoft/UbuntuDockerPi).
It's a 64bit Ubuntu Server with Docker pre-installed.

Indexing large photo and video collections significantly benefits from fast, local SSD storage and enough memory for caching.

## Reducing Server Load ##

If you're running out of memory - or other system resources - while indexing, please limit the
number of workers by setting PHOTOPRISM_WORKERS to a value less than the number of logical CPU cores
in docker-compose.yml.

Also make sure your server has swap configured so that indexing doesn't cause restarts when
there are memory usage spikes.
As a measure of last resort, you may additionally disable image classification using TensorFlow.

To avoid permission issues, docker-compose.yml should include the following security options:

  photoprism:
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
      - apparmor:unconfined
