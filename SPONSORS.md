# A big thank you to all our sponsors! #

## Sponsorship Options ##

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism) is priced in USD, also offers [one-time donations](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism?frequency=one-time), and takes a small commission for currency conversion as we're based in Berlin.
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) has a higher commission, is priced in Euro, and offers yearly payments. That may be a plus for some.
- For next year, we're working on a Stripe integration, so you can sign up directly in the app without having a Patreon or GitHub account.
- You're welcome to [contact us](https://photoprism.app/contact) for other options.
