# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Linux / AMD64)
#
# Note:
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), for example, when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:
#   https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/proxies/traefik/

# CLI Commands:

# All commands may have to be prefixed with "sudo" when not running as root.
# This will point the home directory shortcut ~ to /root in volume mounts.

    ## Don't enable automatic restarts until PhotoPrism has been properly configured and tested!
    ## If the service gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory, filesystem, network, or database issue:

      - "~/Pictures:/photoprism/originals"               # Original media files (DO NOT REMOVE)

      # - "~/Import:/photoprism/import"                  # *Optional* base folder from which files can be imported to originals
      - "./storage:/photoprism/storage"                  # *Writable* storage folder for cache, database, and sidecar files (DO NOT REMOVE)

  ## MariaDB Database Server (recommended)
  ## see https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#should-i-use-sqlite-mariadb-or-mysql
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:11
    ## If MariaDB gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory or filesystem issue:
    ## https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/#fatal-server-errors
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 5s
    security_opt: # see https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-docker/issues/434#issuecomment-1136151239

    ## Never store database files on an unreliable device such as a USB flash drive, an SD card, or a shared network folder:
    volumes:
      - "./database:/var/lib/mysql" # DO NOT REMOVE
    environment:
      MARIADB_AUTO_UPGRADE: "1"

  ## Watchtower upgrades services automatically (optional)
  ## see https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/updates/#watchtower
  ## activate via "COMPOSE_PROFILES=update docker compose up -d"
  watchtower:

    image: containrrr/watchtower
    profiles: ["update"]
    environment:
      WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP: "true"
      WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL: 7200 # checks for updates every two hours
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
