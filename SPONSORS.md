Thank you very much to all of our sponsors!
===========================================

Your continuous support helps...

* to pay for operating expenses and external services like satellite maps
* developing new features, and keeping them free for everyone 🌈

Our [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress, and which feature requests are going to be implemented next. Please give ideas you like a thumbs-up, so that we know what is most popular.

Ideas backed by one or more eligible sponsors will be prioritized as well. Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as unfunded.

You can find us on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism),
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism), and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/photoprism).
