## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before reporting a bug, please use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/)
to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, or an issue has not
(yet) been clearly identified:

- You are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat)
- or post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions)

### GitHub Issues ###

We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in [our source code](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism). Thank you for your careful consideration!

- When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and other information about your environment such as [browser, browser plugins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory), and [processor](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu)
- Note that all issue **subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for discussions, questions or expressing personal opinions
- [Contact us](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives our team the opportunity to [improve the docs](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support to you, instead of handling unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by responding to comments

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

Follow our [step-by-step guide](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/pull-requests) to learn how to submit new features, bug fixes, and documentation enhancements.

Pull requests solving ["help wanted"](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) issues are the easiest to merge and the most helpful to us, as they allow us to spend more time on core functionality and other issues that are difficult for external contributors to work on. If you are new to this project, anything labeled ["easy"](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) may be a good first contribution.

**Be aware that reviewing, testing and finally merging pull requests requires significant resources on our side. It can therefore take several months if it is not just a small fix, especially if extensive testing is needed to prevent bugs from getting into our stable version.**

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA) ##

After you submit your first pull request, you will be asked to accept our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Visit [photoprism.app/cla](https://www.photoprism.app/cla) and [photoprism.app/oss/faq](https://www.photoprism.app/oss/faq#cla) to learn more.

## Project Sponsors ##

## Privacy Notice ##

We operate a number of web services that help us develop and maintain our software in collaboration with the open source community, for example [translate.photoprism.app](https://translate.photoprism.app/).

Because many of these apps and tools were originally developed for internal use without a high level of privacy in mind, we ask that you do not enter personal information such as your real name or personal email address if you want it to remain private.

**Personal details may otherwise show up in logs, source code, translation files, commit messages, and pull request comments.**
