# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Linux / AMD64)
#
# Note:
# - Use SQLite only for small libraries and testing. SQLite locks the index on updates, so other operations have to
#   wait. In the worst case, this can lead to timeout errors. MariaDB is optimized for high concurrency.
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), for example, when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:
#   https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/proxies/traefik/

# Setup Guides:
# - https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/
# - https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/
# - https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/docker/
# - https://www.photoprism.app/kb/activation
#
# CLI Commands:
# - https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/#command-line-interface
#
# All commands may have to be prefixed with "sudo" when not running as root.
# This will point the home directory shortcut ~ to /root in volume mounts.

services:
  photoprism:
    ## Use photoprism/photoprism:preview for testing preview builds:
    image: photoprism/photoprism:latest
    ## Don't enable automatic restarts until PhotoPrism has been properly configured and tested!
    ## If the service gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory, filesystem, network, or database issue:
    ## https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/#fatal-server-errors
    # restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 10s
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
      - apparmor:unconfined
    ## Server port mapping in the format "Host:Container". To use a different port, change the host port on
    ## the left-hand side and keep the container port, e.g. "80:2342" (for HTTP) or "443:2342 (for HTTPS):
    ports:
      - "2342:2342"
    ## Before you start the service, please check the following config options (and change them as needed):
