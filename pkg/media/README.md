Hybrid Photo/Video File Support
===============================

## Apple iPhone and iPad

[iOS Live Photos](https://developer.apple.com/live-photos/) consist of a JPEG/HEIC image and a QuickTime AVC/HEVC video, which are both required for viewing.

We recommend [using an app like PhotoSync](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/sync/mobile-devices/#photosync) to upload Live Photos to PhotoPrism, since the iOS web upload usually only submits the HEIC image file without the video.

## Android Devices

Some Samsung and Google Android devices support taking "Motion Photos" with the included Camera app. Motion Photos are JPEG/HEIC image with a short MP4 video embedded after the image data.

The image part of these files can be opened in any image viewer that supports JPEG/HEIC, but the video part cannot. However, since the MP4 video is simply appended at the end of the image file, it can be easily read by our software and streamed through the API as needed.
